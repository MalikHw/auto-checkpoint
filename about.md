# Auto Checkpoint

Automatically places checkpoints at regular intervals while playing levels in practice mode!

## Features

- **Customizable Interval**: Set how often checkpoints are placed (1-30 seconds)
- **Practice Mode Only**: Option to only place checkpoints in practice mode (recommended)
- **Toggle On/Off**: Easily enable or disable the mod from settings

## How to Use

1. Install the mod
2. Open Geode settings and find "Auto Checkpoint"
3. Set your desired checkpoint interval (default is 5 seconds)
4. Enable the mod
5. Play any level in practice mode - checkpoints will be placed automatically!

## Settings

- **Enable Auto-Checkpoint**: Turn the mod on or off
- **Checkpoint Interval**: How many seconds between each checkpoint (1-30s)
- **Practice Mode Only**: Only place checkpoints in practice mode (prevents accidental use in normal mode)

## Tips

- A 5-second interval works well for most levels
- For harder levels, try a shorter interval (2-3 seconds)
- For easier levels or learning, try a longer interval (10+ seconds)

Enjoy never having to manually place checkpoints again!
